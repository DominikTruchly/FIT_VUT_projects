Password checking program coded in C
Receives a set of passwords on input and verifies for each of them whether the password meets all (fixed) required rules.
The passwords that pass the check will be output, the others will be discarded.


Translation and execution: 
$ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror pwcheck.c -o pwcheck
$ ./pwcheck LEVEL PARAM [--stats] < passwords.txt

LEVEL
an integer in the interval [1, 4] that specifies the required security level (see below)
PARAM
positive integer that specifies an additional rule parameter (see below)
--stats
if specified, determines whether summary statistics of the analyzed passwords should be displayed at the end of the program

----------

Security levels:
-Security levels (controlled rules)
A total of 4 security levels are defined, expressed using 4 rules. The security level specifies that passwords must comply with all rules at the given and lower levels.
Ie. e.g. Security Level 3 specifies that passwords must comply with Rules 1, 2, and 3.

Some rules are parameterizable by an integer specified using the PARAM program argument. In the following list, this parameter is marked as X.

List of rules:

1. The password contains at least 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letter.
2. The password contains characters from at least X groups (if the number X is greater than 4, it means all groups). The groups considered are:
-small letters (a-z)
-capital letters (A-Z)
-numbers (0-9)
-special characters (at least non-alphanumeric characters from the ASCII table at positions 33-126 32-126 must be supported, ie including a space)
3. The password does not contain the same sequence of characters at least X.
4. The password does not contain two identical substrings of length at least X.
